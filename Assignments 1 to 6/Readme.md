## ðŸ“‚ **Project Files & Descriptions**  

### [01_Mad_Libs](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15I70h5RF-qUuzsloPsxOSDZ3wqfUEOOn?usp=drive_link)  
ðŸ“Œ A fun word game where users input random words to complete a story. This project helps beginners understand string manipulation and user input in Python.  

### [02_Guess_The_Number_Computer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1otNPSVaGIrvm9W6pRlMMdTr8Xvl6BVrR?usp=drive_link)  
ðŸ“Œ The computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. This project involves loops, conditionals, and random number generation.  

### [03_Guess_The_Number_User](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jg0Tjx6LIc3rEPWPSiZ32NuEuccBjwqV?usp=drive_link)  
ðŸ“Œ The roles are reversed! The user picks a number, and the computer tries to guess it. The program uses binary search logic for efficiency.  

### [04_Rock_Paper_Scissors](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1auP4yYe1L1nkp7Uf43NlH1U7btYgnRuG?usp=drive_link)  
ðŸ“Œ A simple game where the user plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. This project introduces basic game logic and randomness in Python.  

### [05_Hangman](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lItvJEwSV4Ny_qIn1I8QSrI94kETBLfi?usp=drive_link)  
ðŸ“Œ A word-guessing game where users try to guess letters before running out of chances. This project involves loops, lists, and string manipulation.  

### [06_Countdown_Timer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-dN9-WSGtt0S2fsKyU_heHMqWi95i16U?usp=drive_link)  
ðŸ“Œ A Python script that counts down from a given number to zero. It introduces time-based operations using the `time` module.  

### [07_Password_Generator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17sIq1jUAEl1UJXicoVr36bAaL5UGs_4s?usp=drive_link)
ðŸ“Œ A program that generates strong random passwords based on user preferences. It demonstrates string handling, lists, and randomization.  

### [08_BMI_Calculator]()  
ðŸ“Œ A simple calculator that computes Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input. It introduces basic mathematical operations and conditionals.  

### [09_Python_Website_Streamlit](z)  
ðŸ“Œ A project using **Streamlit** to create a basic website with Python. It helps students explore web development without complex frontend coding.
